# Line numbers in `cat` command
TIL: With extra flag `-n` we can print the line numbers in `cat` command.
(No need to load file in vim for line numbers anymore :) )


### Command
```
$ cat -n filename
```


### Bonus
You can use [`bat`](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) (as they call it, `cat` with wings), if you want:
1. Syntax Highlighting
2. Line numbers
3. Paging
4. pipe like in cat.
5. etc
